The code snippets in this repository are purely for my own OpenCV learning. 

The idea, for now, is that each script will be a standalone program that 
tackles some idea or exercise.

**Ideas to implement/refine:**
[ ] Document scanner
[ ] Script to count the number of windows on a building face
[ ] License plate tracking and image processing
